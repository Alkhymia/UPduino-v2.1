## UPDuino v2.1: PCB Design Files, Designs, Documentation

The UPDuino v2.1 is a small, low cost FPGA board, built with license from Lattice Semiconductor. The board features an on-board FPGA programmer, flash and LED with all pins brought out to easy to use 0.1" header pins for fast prototyping.

The tinyVision.ai UPduino v2.1 Board Features:

* Lattice UltraPlus ICE40UP5K FPGA with 5.3K LUTs, 1Mb SPRAM, 120Kb DPRAM, 8 Multipliers
* FTDI FT232H USB to SPI Device
* 30 GPIO on 0.1‚Äù headers
* 8MB SPI Flash
* RGB LED
* On board 3.3V and 1.2V Regulators, can supply 3.3V to your project
* Open source schematic and layout using free Eagle PCB design tools and an RGB LED Example Project.
* Improved USB footprint to minimize connectors ripping off the board
